# üìä MSFF Power Comparison Across Different Time Periods

This repository contains SPICE simulations for comprehensive power and energy analysis of Master-Slave Flip-Flop (MSFF) designs across various clock periods to evaluate energy-delay trade-offs and performance metrics.

## üéØ Objective

To characterize the energy-delay behavior of a Master-Slave Flip-Flop (MSFF) and evaluate cost functions like Energy √ó Delay and Power √ó Delay to understand trade-offs between power, performance, and energy efficiency across different operating frequencies.

## üî¨ Design Concept & Theory

### Energy-Delay Analysis Framework
- **Energy vs Delay**: Characterizes energy consumption variation with timing parameters
- **Power vs Delay**: Analyzes instantaneous power requirements at different speeds
- **Cost Function Optimization**: Identifies optimal energy-performance trade-off points

### Key Performance Metrics

#### Energy √ó Delay (Cost Function)
- **Definition**: Measures energy efficiency relative to performance
- **Significance**: Energy spent per unit of speed achievement
- **Optimization Goal**: Lower values indicate superior energy-performance balance
- **Design Impact**: Guides selection of optimal operating points

#### Power √ó Delay (PDP - Power-Delay Product)
- **Definition**: Power required during operation at given delay
- **Significance**: Energy consumed per switching operation
- **Industry Standard**: Widely used figure-of-merit for circuit performance
- **Design Utility**: Compares power efficiency across different timing requirements

## üìà Analysis Parameters

### Clock Period Variations
The MSFF was characterized across five different time periods:
- **1 ns** (1000 MHz frequency)  [setup + clk_to_q = 100ps]
- **2 ns** (500 MHz frequency)   [setup + clk_to_q = 200ps]
- **4 ns** (250 MHz frequency)   [setup + clk_to_q = 400ps]
- **8 ns** (125 MHz frequency)   [setup + clk_to_q = 800ps]
- **16 ns** (62.5 MHz frequency) [setup + clk_to_q = 1.6ns]

### Measured Parameters
For each clock period, the following metrics were extracted:
- **D‚ÜíCLK Delay**: Data setup timing requirement
- **CLK‚ÜíQ Delay**: Clock-to-output propagation delay
- **D‚ÜíQ Delay**: Total data propagation delay
- **Average Power**: Mean power consumption during operation
- **Energy per Cycle**: Total energy consumed per clock cycle
