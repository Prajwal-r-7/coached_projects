# üõ†Ô∏è CoachED VLSI Projects Repository

Welcome to my repository of VLSI design and simulation projects completed as part of the **CoachED VLSI Training Program**.

This repo contains all the hands-on projects and exercises I worked on during the CoachED journey ‚Äî starting with **analog and digital circuit simulations in NGSpice**, and gradually progressing towards **RTL design and implementation using Verilog HDL**.
